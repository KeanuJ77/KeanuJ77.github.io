<H1> How to Make a Pizza </H1> 

To make a pizza you first need to preheat oven to 500 Degrees F or 260 Degrees. Form the Dough. After you preheat the oven, you knead the dough for 8-10 minutes. You then spray the pizza pan with cooking spray and spread the dough out on the pan. Once you finish spreading the dough, you then bake just the crust for at least 5 minutes. The next step would be making the pizza sauce, pour the sauce over the baked crust, sprinkle cheese on top, Add Bacon, Peppers, & Pepperoni toppings. After all the toppings are put on the pizza, you should bake again for 5-7 minutes and enjoy your pizza.
