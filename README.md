<H1> About me </H1>
-	My name is Cole Johnson or Keanu for short. I am from a family of 5 and a middle child. I moved from California when I was 8 years old and have lived here ever since. I am currently trying to figure out what major to study. Also my pet fish died because I wanted to have him in a bigger living space, so I put him in the toilet then accidently flushed him. PS donâ€™t give me a pet.

<H2> My Interests </H2>

-I like long walks on the beach
-Playing soccer on the weekends
-The movies Lilo and Stitch, and Moana
-Eating random types of foods

<H2> Websites I Recommend </H2>

[youtube](https://www.youtube.com) 

Youtube is a streaming platform to watch reel or videos. I recommend it because it can be very educational to watch certain videos.

[spotify](https://www.spotify.com)

Spotify is a music platform that allows the user to listen to any type of music they want. Spotify also allows the subcriber to have a premium spotify account with non ads or they can listen for free with ads.
